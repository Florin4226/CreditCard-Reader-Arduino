# 💳Credit Card Reader Arduino

Out of boredom today I made a credit card reader using a little AI :) I made it more out of boredom.


# 📌 Feautres

- Read a credit card fast and print to console

# 👀 What options are coming soon?
I assume the following features will come soon:

- The data should be displayed on an LCD or OLED display
- Can read a pet's microchip (Inspired by Flipper Zero)
